## Visualization

## Animations

## Interactions

## Data Model


## Requirements
This example requires:

* the RaVis library that can be found [here](https://github.com/pearltrees/ravis)

## Setting up project and components

#### Flash Library
This is a Flex 3.5 project and is compiled using playerglobal.swc for 10.1. You can
download it in the following [zip file](/Playerglobal.10.1.zip) and replace the existing
file in {YOUR_FLASH_BUILDER_PATH}\sdks\3.5\frameworks\libs\player\10\playerglobal.swc

#### Ravis Project Import
Ravis is the library used for the visualization of our tree organization. You need to
import it as a separate project in your workspace. You can find it [here](https://github.com/pearltrees/ravis).

#### PearltreesAssets Project Import
PearltreesAssets project is necessary to get the assets used in the layout of our pearls.
Therefore, you also need to import it as a separate project in your workspace. You
can find it [here] (https://github.com/pearltrees/PearltreesAssets).

#### PearltreesCore
You finally need to import the PearltreesCore project in your workspace and add the above
Ravis and PearltreesAssets projects in your Library Path. 

#### PearlExample
PearlExample is a separate project that can be found [here](https://github.com/pearltrees/PearlExample), it is an example
code to easily draw a tree and its pearls. Here is an example output tree representation that
you can make with this example:
